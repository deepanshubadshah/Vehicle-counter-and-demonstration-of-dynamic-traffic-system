Vehicle counter and demonstration of dynamic traffic system.
Result demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3t1LK6N2aw

It's a project demo for a dynamic traffic light system, where live timing of the signal is a function
of the number of vehicles in the frame.

Signal live timing (Greenlight duration) = 15*(No. of vehicles in the frame) Seconds

e.g. if there are 10 vehicles in the frame then live timing = 150sec.
Hence live timing will be more for the signal with more vehicles.
